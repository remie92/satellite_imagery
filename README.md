#Satellites!

Some satellite imagery that I got from my own atennas!  
*(Currently only from the Meteor M2-3 and Meteor M2-4 sattelites)*

---

## Setup

Using a **RTL-SDR USB** with **SatDump** software!

---

## Github Page

I'm uploading any good passes I get on here! To look at the final images, find the ones named: `"msu_mr_rgb_MCIR_corrected_map.png"`, or `"msu_mr_rgb_MCIR_corrected.png"`. (First one has visible lines between the countries, the latter one doesn't).

These are colored ones, and manually rotated by me, since they are generated upsidedown for some reason by SatDump. You might want to rotate them back if you want to use the product files in SatDump yourself.

There are also some infrared images, and others!

## Antennas I Made

### V - Dipole Antenna

First one is a **V - Dipole antenna**, it's a bit wonky, but I did get images with it!

Made in an afternoon, it's a **PVC pipe structure**, with a **3D printed part** to hold the pipes at the corrent angles.  
One arm is connected to the **shield** of a coax cable, and the other arm to the **center** of the coax cable.  
This is plugged in directly into the **RTL-SDR USB**.  

> It is directional, and doesn't work that well for a long continous signal.  
> But it's good enough to get images out of it, and there is no noise since the Meteor satellites are digital with error correction build in!

### QFH (Quadrifilar Helix Antenna)

My second antenna is a **QFH (quadrifilar helix antenna)**

This one took a while to make, the actual building took an afternoon and evening, but it was a bit hard to find *any* instructions.  
I eventually found a site that could generate to correct lengths for the frequency I needed to receive, but I was only like 50% sure I was building it right.
And it worked great! You can see the pictures on the github! 
It's still a bit directional, but it seems to be way less sensitive to rotation and movement than the V - Dipole.
